# BanAddon
 Wow, the new version of the ban addon is now available open source on github!

### One of my oldest projects is now continued!
I  decided Im coming back to releasing addons for you, so to kick things off,
I wanted to update the ban addon to the newest version and clean up the mess other people left behind over the years.

### Before you proceed
You are **not** allowed to use this code in your own addon in any type of way, but you can look at it.
You can also modify it for private use only.
